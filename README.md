# Todo Application

The purpose of this project for me was to get familiar with the basics of the Laravel framework, focusing on the functionality rather then the styling of the application.  
This project contains an implementation of a **To-do application**.

#### Users can:
1) Login and Register
2) See a tasklist after login
3) Manage tasks
    - 3.1. Create
    - 3.2. Update
    - 3.3. Delete
    - 3.4. Set status (in progress / finished)

### My database setup
1) Create a Supabase database
2) Create a Schema named "laravel_todo"
3) With the artisan command line tool run - *php artisan migrate*

### To run the applicaiton
1) Open a terminal and run - *npm run dev*
1) Open another terminal and run - *php artisan serve*

#### Resources I used to learn and develop:
1) Official Laravel documentation (https://laravel.com/docs/12.x)
2) Youtube
    - 2.1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M84Nk7iWkA
    - 2.2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkHJDSl0-yE
3) Stackoverflow (Anytime I got stuck with an error or any kind of issue)
4) (The next resource I will use in detail is the https://laracasts.com/ website.)

#### Tools I used for development:
1) Windows operating system
2) Herd - for setting up the development enviroment on Windows
3) Visual Studio Code (with the free version of the PHP extension)
4) Windows command prompt for *artisan* and other types of commands
5) Claude AI - for the styling of the application
